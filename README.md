# risosv2
welcome to ris-osv2. this is a rethought version of risos.due to unforseen complications... the original risos has been abandoned
this is the plans for the updated version:
1.grub bootloader
2.ubuntu linux kernel(or custom maybe?)
3.wayland backend with custom gui
this entire project is being rethought.
updates will be formatted as such:
0.0.1:micro update(singular bug fixes, no new functions)
0.1.0:minor update(bug fixes,new functions)
1.0.0:major update:(redesign, bug fixes, new look(maybe?), significantly new functions)
note:this project has been put off until the winter. do not expect very much until then
